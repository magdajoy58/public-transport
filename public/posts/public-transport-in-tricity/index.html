Don’t worry, we got you.\nFirst of all, it’s worth mentioning that there are many different means of public transport in this area of Poland. In Gdansk, you can get on a bus or hop on a tram, but that’s not it. There are also SKM trains, which allow you to commute not only within Gdansk but also to Sopot, Gdynia (and even some other places just outside of Tricity). You won’t find any trams in Sopot and Gdynia but buses are there too. In Gdynia, you can also get around on a trolley bus. This might all sound a little overwhelming, especially when it’s your first time here, but don’t worry. We’ll provide you with all the information you need.\nTicket information Buses and trams in Gdansk All information about tickets for buses and trams in Gdansk can be found here. Unfortunately, this website is not in English but you can use google translate to display it in your language. The tickets can be purchased at either bus stops or tram stops in a dedicated ticket machines. You need to remember that these are not at every stop so it is good to have an alternative. You can check if there’s a ticket machine near you here. Tickets for buses and trams can also be bought from the driver, but only on routes: 107, 117, 122, 126, 132, 143, 171, 174, 200, 205, 207, 232, 255, 256, 607 and N5. SKM SKM tickets can be bought at train stations in ticket machines (again, these aren’t available at every station). It’s important to keep in mind that they are only valid for the upcoming train, you can’t buy them in advance and you don’t have to validate them. You can also buy them on board. To do this, you need to go to the front of the train and look for a person in a uniform. At bigger train stations tickets can be bought from cashiers too.You’ll find more information about SKM tickets here. Buses in Gdynia If you decide you want to take the bus in Gdynia you should check out this website. It has all the necessary information you need. However, if you want to buy a ticket you’ll need to use an app. Jakdojade is probably one of the most popular and easiest ways of buying tickets, providing that you have a mobile phone with access to the Internet. It is an app that allows you to buy a ticket for every form of transport. You can download it from Google Play store or App store. Other apps, where you can get your tickets are:\nGoPay - Google Play download, App Store download moBILET - Google Play download, App Store download mPay - Google Play download, App Store download skycash - Google Play download, App Store download If you buy a standard, paper ticket for the bus, train or SKM (tickets bought from cashiers) you need to validate it. Trams and buses have small machines on board, you have to enter your ticket into them, so that your ticket can get stamped with the date and time of the beginning of your journey. To validate a SKM ticket you need to do the same, the machines are not located inside the trains, but at the train stations. If you don’t do this you can get a fine. You can also get a fine if you don’t have a ticket at all. There is also a thing called Metropolitan ticket. This ticket allows you to use public transport from Gdansk, Gdynia and Wejherowo (just outside of the Tricity). You can read more about it here. For each means of transport there are many varieties of tickets such as a single fare ticket, a 24h ticket or even a monthly ticket, so it’s best to visit the above-mentioned websites and chose the ones that suit you best. Ticket prices differ depending on ticket type but generally you have to be prepared around 4.80 PLN for a single fare ticket for a bus or a tram. SKM prices depend on how far you’re going but the cheapest ticket is also 4.80 PLN. If you are a student make sure to bring your student card with you because you might be entitled to a discount.\nRoute planning Each tram or bus in Tricity has a number. The number indicates the route and direction in which it is going. When it comes to SKM trains, they don’t have numbers, just the direction. To make sure you take the right bus, train or tram use a route planning app. One of the most popular apps used by locals is the already-mentioned app Jakdojade. Besides buying tickets, it also has other features such as route planning. It asks you to provide your departure spot and your destination and it comes up with possible travel routes. This app shows you how long your journey will take too. Google Maps has a similar feature to Jakdojade. Once you open the app, all you have to do is type in where you’d like to go and click on ‘directions’, you then have to provide your starting point. Then you have to click on transit mode and Google Maps will show you what means of transport will take you there and how long your commute will take. If you’re not that tech-savvy you can always go to a tourist information centre or ask the receptionist at your hotel to help you. Visit the website of the tourist information centre in Gdansk, Sopot, and Gdynia.\nBest transport mode for the time of the day or a particular area Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia might be busy during rush hours. These are early morning and late afternoon when people commute to and from work or school. If you want to use public transport during these hours it is best to go for a tram, SKM or PKM trains as these are rail-based and won’t get stuck in traffic, unlike buses. The traffic is especially heavy in areas such as Wrzeszcz and the city centre in Gdansk, Aleja Niepodleglosci in Sopot, Morksa, Wielkopolska and Chwaszczynska street in Gdynia. So, if possible it’s better to avoid travelling to these areas during rush hours.\nPossible alternatives for a popular route Tricity has many beautiful spots, so if you are here during the summer you’ll see a lot of people using public transport. If you’re staying in Gdansk and want to go to Sopot you’ll usually take the SKM train as it is faster than a bus. However, if you are staying outside of the city centre and there’s no train station near you you might be able to take a direct bus from Gdansk to Sopot. For example, if your hotel is located near the airport you can take the 122 bus which goes to Sopot. That way you only have to buy one ticket, instead of taking a bus to Wrzeszcz and then taking the SKM train. It might take longer but this route drives past some nice places such as the Oliwa Park, so you’ll enjoy the views.\n",

However, if you are staying outside of the city centre and there’s no train station near you you might be able to take a direct bus from Gdansk to Sopot. For example, if your hotel is located near the airport you can take the <em>122</em> bus which goes to Sopot. That way you only have to buy one ticket, instead of taking a bus to Wrzeszcz and then taking the SKM train. It might take longer but this route drives past some nice places such as the Oliwa Park, so you’ll enjoy the views.</p>
